      "This code will output `Sorted Array is: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9` which are all numbers sorted from lowest to highest as expected by Quick Sort. The key part about this implementation is that we choose one number from our array and use it as a 'pivot' point around which we want to organize everything else. We then recursively apply these steps on both sides of the pivot until every single item has been placed into its correct position. This results in a fully ordered list when finished.\n",

It returns new location of pivot after placing it correctly. Here is what happens step by step:\n",
      "1. Choose the last element as pivot.\n",

      "Now, if you run this script, your application should start up and be available at http://localhost:8000/. You could test it out directly via curl or Postman but more convenient way would be opening browser and going to url like ws://localhost:8000/ws . Then just type some text into input field and press Enter - message sent to server and response returned immediately after pressing Enter key.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, here's how you might set up a simple Python WebSocket Client:\n",

      "# Importing required libraries\n",
      "import asyncio\n",

      "       await websocket.send(\"Hello world\")\n",
      "       response = await websocket.recv()\n",
      "       print(response)\n",
      "\n",
      "asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(hello())\n",

      "You need to install 'websockets' library first. If not installed yet, do so by running pip command below:\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "pip install websockets\n",
      "```\n",
      "When you execute this script, it connects to the WebSocket server, sends the string \"Hello World\", waits for a response, prints the result, and disconnects. Make sure your server is already running before trying to connect to its WebSocket interface.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that these examples are very basic and don't cover error handling scenarios such as when network issues occur during communication between clients and servers etc., they only serve illustrative purposes. For production grade applications, proper design patterns must be followed including things like authentication, rate limiting, logging, exception tracking etc. Also remember to secure your web sockets properly especially over unsecured networks.\n",
